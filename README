rainman is a pure python implementation of the bittorrent protocol with
tornado integration.

this was last hacked on in march 2012 so the code is rusty and i've
forgotten many of the details, but feel free to pick it up.  untuned peers
should have reasonable performance (~20MB/s/process using CPython in 2012.)
