rainman is a pure python implementation of the bittorrent protocol on top of
tornado.

currently undergoing a breaking refactor, but most of the individual
components are tested and functional.

to run tests:

  >> ./pants tests/rainman:all -v

to generate a source distribution:

  >> ./pants setup_py src/rainman

or an egg distribution

  >> ./pants setup_py --run=bdist_egg src/rainman

there are three tools which can be built in the following manner:

  >> ./pants src/rainmain/bin:client
  >> ./pants src/rainmain/bin:make_torrent
  >> ./pants src/rainmain/bin:tracker

this will produce .pex files which are self-contained hashbanged python
executables.  client/tracker currently non-functional.
