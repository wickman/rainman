rainman is a pure python implementation of the bittorrent protocol on top of
tornado.

currently undergoing a refactor, but most of the individual components are
tested and functional.

to run tests:

  >> ./pants tests/rainman:all -v

to run a bittorrent session live on your laptop (like magic!)

  >> ./pants py src/rainman/bin:test_integration --inmemory
